# turbine-wakes
This program works with the Py_Wake library and a modified Jensen model for wind
turbines, in order to calculate wake deficits in a wind farm.

# How to Run
This program can be run from the command line by calling, 
"python main_wake_model_new.py" to run with default parameters. If there is a 
configuration file being used then run using "python main_wake_model_new.py 
--config_file "file_name".json --load_config". The parameters for this simulation
can also be set manually using the command line (following specifications found in 
data_config_new_wake.py)
